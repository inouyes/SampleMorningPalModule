Morning Pal Modules
====
[McHacks 2015](http://mchacks.io) project by Maclyn Brandwein, Sean Inouye, and Brian Yang 

Morning Pal is for anyone with a morning routine who'd rather brush his teeth half-asleep than brush his teeth and browse through the news, weather, and his day on his phone half asleep. We collate information from a variety of modules (which can be easily written and extended, and only run when asked to) in a simple gesture controlled UI. Your phone then reads your daily routine out to you, letting you jump in with a quick gesture to get more information about topic you're interested in.

This repository contains some modules used in conjuction with the main app: https://github.com/maclyn/morningpal
